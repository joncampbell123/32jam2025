TODO:

- Windows 95 fullscreen mode: Add a fullscreen window flag. This flag, if set while
  fullscreen, instructs the game to query Windows 95 for the desktop area NOT covered
  by the taskbar so that the Windows 95 start menu/taskbar is always visible.
  SystemParametersInfo() exists in Windows 3.1 and Win16 code under 95 can also use
  it to query this area, so it's not something limited to 32-bit. Limit that code to
  WINVER >= 0x30A (Windows 3.1), because SystemParametersInfo() did not exist until
  Windows 3.1 and we're not going to go out of our way to GetProcAddress() it
  dynamically unless there's a pressing need to do so. We're a game engine that needs
  to run as light and tight as possible, not a DOSLIB demonstration program.

- "make.sh cdrom" to copy the game executables and all game files into an ISO image
  (make sure to pass -J for Joliet extensions so Windows 95 can see the full
  "long filenames"!) that any emulator can easily present to Windows 95 as a CD-ROM
  drive. To make testing easier. Of course, game devs targeting Windows 3.1 are going
  to want to keep all filenames 8.3 because "long filenames" didn't exist until 95.

- Figure out how a Win32 version can detect another instance of itself. A recommended
  method out there is to use CreateMutex with a name based on a unique identifier in
  the application (a GUID, perhaps?).

  A cursory examination of old releases of Windows 3.1 Win32s shows that CreateMutex
  exists in every Win32s release since the initial release, and should be safe to use.

  CreateMutex by default in Windows NT puts them in the local kernel namespace, so,
  that technique is not going to prevent the game from multiple instances across
  multiple users. [https://www.codeproject.com/articles/Using-a-Win32-Mutex-to-Figure-Out-if-an-Applicatio#comments-section]
  in which case perhaps another bit could be assigned to signal not to allow multiple
  instances on Windows NT even across user accounts. According to the code sample,
  that could be done by naming the mutex "global\{UNIQUE IDENTIFIER}" instead of just
  "{UNIQUE IDENTIFIER}". Of course, knowing Microsoft, "global\" probably doesn't
  work under Windows 95. We'll cross this bridge when it matters.

DONE:

- Begin GameFlags bitfield. Define first constant as one that determines whether or
  not the game allows multiple instances. If not set, show an error message if
  hPrevInstance != NULL. Win16 only (or Win32s?), for now.

- Window config "minimize on deactivate" flag. If set, and the user navigates to another
  Windows application, the game window will minimize itself (deactivate case of
  WM_ACTIVATE).

- Windows 3.x fullscreen mode: In addition to WndFSNone and WndFSFullscreen, add a
  WndFSFullscreenTopmost mode. Same as WndFSFullscreen but uses SetWindowPos to
  give it a HWND_TOPMOST z-order.

- Windows 3.x: Reply to WM_GETMINMAXINFO to return a maximized window position such that
  maximizing the window centers it on the screen instead of positioning it in the upper
  left corner as Windows likes to do by default.
