TODO:

- Windows 3.x fullscreen mode: In addition to WndFSNone and WndFSFullscreen, add a
  WndFSFullscreenTopmost mode. Same as WndFSFullscreen but uses SetWindowPos to
  give it a HWND_TOPMOST z-order.

DONE:

- Windows 3.x: Reply to WM_GETMINMAXINFO to return a maximized window position such that
  maximizing the window centers it on the screen instead of positioning it in the upper
  left corner as Windows likes to do by default.
