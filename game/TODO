TODO:

- GDI offscreen compositing buffer (HBITMAP + HDC from CreateCompatibleBitamp and
  CreateCompatibleDC). All sprite rendering is to go to that buffer.

- Test draw BMP goes to compositing buffer, and then composed to screen.

- PNG image loader: If at some point this code is to support "truecolor" PNG images,
  support for the various filtering modes will have to be implemented. Most programs
  do not do filtering for indexed color but will always do filtering for truecolor
  PNG images.

DONE:

- PNG image loader: The way that 1bpp monochrome images have transparency is by encoding
  the image as 2bpp, even if only to encode 3 colors, so that one color can be transparent.
  If 2bpp and there is a tRNS chunk that marks at least one color as transparent, and
  the PLTE has only 3 colors, convert the 2bpp on load to a 1bpp image and 1bpp mask.

- PNG image loader: Read tRNS chunk to determine which colors are transparent. In the
  Windows 3.1/95 world, colors are either opaque or invisible (used as a color key for
  sprite transparency). Opacity is either 100% or 0%.

- PNG image loader: Use tRNS map to determine which colors are transparent, or if the
  PNG has any transparency at all, and if so, generate the second HBITMAP for the
  sprite mask, setting any pixel that is transparent to black, or else white.

- Windows 95 fullscreen mode: Add a fullscreen window flag. This flag, if set while
  fullscreen, instructs the game to query Windows 95 for the desktop area NOT covered
  by the taskbar so that the Windows 95 start menu/taskbar is always visible.
  SystemParametersInfo() exists in Windows 3.1 and Win16 code under 95 can also use
  it to query this area, so it's not something limited to 32-bit. Limit that code to
  WINVER >= 0x30A (Windows 3.1), because SystemParametersInfo() did not exist until
  Windows 3.1 and we're not going to go out of our way to GetProcAddress() it
  dynamically unless there's a pressing need to do so. We're a game engine that needs
  to run as light and tight as possible, not a DOSLIB demonstration program.

- "make.sh cdrom" to copy the game executables and all game files into an ISO image
  (make sure to pass -J for Joliet extensions so Windows 95 can see the full
  "long filenames"!) that any emulator can easily present to Windows 95 as a CD-ROM
  drive. To make testing easier. Of course, game devs targeting Windows 3.1 are going
  to want to keep all filenames 8.3 because "long filenames" didn't exist until 95.

- Begin GameFlags bitfield. Define first constant as one that determines whether or
  not the game allows multiple instances. If not set, show an error message if
  hPrevInstance != NULL. Win16 only (or Win32s?), for now.

- Window config "minimize on deactivate" flag. If set, and the user navigates to another
  Windows application, the game window will minimize itself (deactivate case of
  WM_ACTIVATE).

- Windows 3.x fullscreen mode: In addition to WndFSNone and WndFSFullscreen, add a
  WndFSFullscreenTopmost mode. Same as WndFSFullscreen but uses SetWindowPos to
  give it a HWND_TOPMOST z-order.

- Windows 3.x: Reply to WM_GETMINMAXINFO to return a maximized window position such that
  maximizing the window centers it on the screen instead of positioning it in the upper
  left corner as Windows likes to do by default.
