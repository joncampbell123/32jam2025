FIXED BUGS, Windows 3.0

- WM_GETMINMAXINFO is able to enforce fullscreen mode, but if you minimize, then
  restore the window to maximized, Windows 3.0 calls WM_GETMINMAXINFO but then
  ignores the window size info and shows the window as a normal maximized window
  state (caption, sysmenu, etc. visible). Windows 3.1 actually obeys the result.
  You can get Windows 3.0 to properly position and size the window if you manually
  double click the title bar.
