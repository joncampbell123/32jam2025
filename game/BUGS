NOTE: This game engine currently targets and focuses on compatibility with
      Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 only.

Watcom Win386:
* NOTE: Even though Win386 can target Windows 3.1 and 95, this is not a primary
        target for the game engine yet.

- Game engine as Win386 32-bit application causes crashes when it handles
  WM_GETMINMAXINFO, WM_WINPOSCHANGING, and similar functions that typecast
  lparam to a pointer. If there is a function in Win386 to covnert a 16:16
  pointer to 32-bit in order to safely use it properly, I'd like to know.


Windows 3.0:
* NOTE: Windows 3.0 is not a primary target for this game engine yet.

[NONE]



Windows 2.0:
* NOTE: Windows 2.0 is not a primary target for this game engine yet.

- Fullscreen mode works but it does not alter the system menu yet. It should use
  Windows 2.x level APIs to do the same changes to the sysmenu as it does Windows 3.x.


FIXED BUGS, Windows 3.0

- WM_GETMINMAXINFO is able to enforce fullscreen mode, but if you minimize, then
  restore the window to maximized, Windows 3.0 calls WM_GETMINMAXINFO but then
  ignores the window size info and shows the window as a normal maximized window
  state (caption, sysmenu, etc. visible). Windows 3.1 actually obeys the result.
  You can get Windows 3.0 to properly position and size the window if you manually
  double click the title bar.
