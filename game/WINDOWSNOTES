- AdjustWindowRect / AdjustWindowRectEx

  Documented to take a client area rect and adjust it to product a window area rect.
  Under Windows 3.0 and Windows 3.1 the height computed is one pixel too small.
  Sometimes for WS_POPUP it is two pixels too small. For example if I ask for a
  client area of 320x240, you'll likely get a client area of 320x239 or 320x238.

  Windows 1.x and 2.x have not yet been tested for this bug.

  Microsoft appears to have fixed this bug in Windows 95/NT4.

- POSIX open() O_TEXT default. If you intend to read/write data, DOS/Windows C
  libraries by default will translate \r\n to \n on read and \n to \r\n on write.
  To read binary data, you need to add O_BINARY. Note that DOS and Windows are
  the only platforms to require O_BINARY, it's not even defined on other platforms.
