- AdjustWindowRect / AdjustWindowRectEx

  Documented to take a client area rect and adjust it to product a window area rect.
  Under Windows 3.0 and Windows 3.1 the height computed is one pixel too small.
  Sometimes for WS_POPUP it is two pixels too small. For example if I ask for a
  client area of 320x240, you'll likely get a client area of 320x239 or 320x238.

  Windows 1.x and 2.x have not yet been tested for this bug.

  Microsoft appears to have fixed this bug in Windows 95/NT4.

- POSIX open() O_TEXT default. If you intend to read/write data, DOS/Windows C
  libraries by default will translate \r\n to \n on read and \n to \r\n on write.
  To read binary data, you need to add O_BINARY. Note that DOS and Windows are
  the only platforms to require O_BINARY, it's not even defined on other platforms.

- The following functions are listed as exports in Windows 3.1 Win32s but are not
  actually implemented:

  CreateDIBSection
  CreateThread (or any thread related function--Win32s does not implement threads)

- Windows 3.1 Win32s: CreateMutex works but all mutexes are local to your application.
  You cannot use a named mutex to synchronize across processes like you can in
  Windows 95/NT or later.

- Watcom's Win386 extender works perfectly fine normally, but if you link your program
  to MMSYSTEM in Windows 3.1, all manner or strange instability and crashes happen,
  including mysterious hangs merely calling GetTickCount(). Perhaps their thunks and
  covers don't like the Windows 3.1 multimedia functions.
